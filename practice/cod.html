        <div class="class">The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified in an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed, allowing the virus to spread to other areas of Asia and later worldwide in 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020. The WHO ended its PHEIC declaration on 5 May 2023; prior to this, some countries had already begun to regard COVID-19 as an endemic disease.[6][7][8] As of 10 August 2023, the pandemic had caused 769,369,059[3] cases and 6,954,323[3] confirmed deaths, ranking it fifth in the deadliest epidemics and pandemics in history</div>

            <h1>RAIGAD</h1>
            <P>Raigad, situated in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, India, is a hill fort located in the town of Mahad. It is one of the strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau and was historically referred to as Rairee or Rairy fort.[1]

                Chhatrapati Shivaji, the Maratha ruler, along with the Chief Engineer Hiroji Indulkar, oversaw the construction and development of various buildings and structures within Raigad. In 1674, after being crowned the king of the Maratha kingdom, Shivaji chose Raigad as his capital. Under his reign, the Maratha Empire expanded to encompass a significant portion of western and central India.[2]
                
                Located at an elevation of 820 metres (2,700 ft) (2,700 ft) above its base and 1,356 m (4,449 ft) (4,449 ft) above sea level within the Sahyadri mountain range, the fort offers views of the surrounding area. Accessing the fort requires ascending approximately 1,737 steps. Alternatively, visitors can opt for the Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway spanning 750 m (2,460 ft) (2,460 ft) in length and reaching a height of 400 m (1,300 ft) (1,300 ft), which conveniently transports them from the ground to the fort in just four minutes.
